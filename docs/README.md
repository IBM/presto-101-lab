# Introduction

## Presto Workshop - Building an Open Data Lakehouse with Presto

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop, you’ll learn the basics of Presto, the open-source SQL query engine.
You’ll get Presto running locally on your machine, connect data sources, and run some queries.
This is a beginner-level workshop for software developers and engineers who are new to Presto.
At the end of the workshop, you will understand how to federate queries using Presto. 

The goals of this workshop are:

* What is Presto and why you’d use it
* How to write a Presto query
* How to create and deploy a Presto cluster on your machine using Docker
* How to add 2 data sources (MySQL and MongoDB) and query them
* How to create dashboards/visualizations of your data
